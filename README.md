# BootstrapReactJS
Bootstrap a minimal ReactJS project without using create-react-app

- git clone https://github.com/angshuman-agarwal/BootstrapReactJS.git 
- On your your local machine, cd into BootstrapReactJS folder
- Spawn your favourite command line tool at this location & execute the following:
  - npm install
  - npm run build
  - npm start

That should spawn a browser served by [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) on localhost and show Webpage rendered using ReactJS. This is the minimal scaffolding required to bootstrap a modern ReactJS based project using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
